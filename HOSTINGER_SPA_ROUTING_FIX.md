# Hostinger SPA Routing Fix Guide

## Problem
When you navigate to routes like `/contact` or `/services` and refresh the page, you get a 404 "This Page Does Not Exist" error from Hostinger instead of your React app loading.

## Root Cause
Hostinger's server configuration may not be processing `.htaccess` files correctly, or the hosting plan might not support Apache mod_rewrite.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Fixed .htaccess File
Upload this simplified `.htaccess` file to your `public_html` directory:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle SPA routing - redirect all non-file requests to index.html
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [L]

# Error document fallback
ErrorDocument 404 /index.html
```

### Solution 2: Alternative .htaccess Format
If Solution 1 doesn't work, try this format:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### Solution 3: Contact Hostinger Support
Ask Hostinger support to:
1. Enable `mod_rewrite` module for your domain
2. Confirm `.htaccess` files are allowed
3. Check if there are any server-level restrictions
4. Verify your hosting plan supports URL rewriting

### Solution 4: Manual Server Configuration
Ask Hostinger support to add this to your server configuration:

```apache
<Directory "/path/to/your/domain">
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [L]
</Directory>
```

### Solution 5: Alternative Hosting Approach
If Hostinger doesn't support proper SPA routing:

1. **Use Netlify or Vercel** (free alternatives with built-in SPA support)
2. **Upgrade Hostinger plan** to one that supports Apache modules
3. **Use subdirectory approach** - host at `yourdomain.com/app/` instead of root

## Testing Steps

After implementing any solution:

1. **Clear browser cache** completely
2. **Test these URLs directly**:
   - `yourdomain.com/contact`
   - `yourdomain.com/services`
   - `yourdomain.com/about`
3. **Refresh each page** to ensure it loads your React app
4. **Check browser console** for any errors

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `.htaccess` file is in the root `public_html` directory
- [ ] File permissions are correct (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- [ ] All files from `dist` folder are uploaded
- [ ] Browser cache is cleared
- [ ] Tested on different browsers/devices

## If Nothing Works

This indicates Hostinger's configuration doesn't support SPA routing. Consider:

1. **Moving to Netlify/Vercel** (recommended for React apps)
2. **Using hash routing** in React Router (not ideal but works)
3. **Contacting Hostinger** for enterprise support

## Hash Router Fallback (Last Resort)

If server-side routing is impossible, modify your React app to use hash routing:

```javascript
// In your main routing file
import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

// URLs will become: yourdomain.com/#/contact
```

This works without server configuration but creates less clean URLs.
