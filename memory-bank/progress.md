# Syntellite Progress Log

## Recent Fixes (January 8, 2025)

### Issue: 404 Error on Page Refresh

**Problem**: When users visited `syntellite.com/coming-soon` and refreshed the page, they received a 404 error instead of the coming soon page.

**Root Cause**: The server was trying to find a physical file at `/coming-soon` instead of serving the SPA's index.html file for client-side routing.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. Updated `.htaccess` configuration with improved SPA routing rules
2. Added explicit error document handling (404 and 403 redirect to index.html)
3. Enhanced file type exclusions to prevent interference with static assets
4. Added proper MIME types and security headers
5. Ensured .htaccess files are present in:
   - Root directory (`.htaccess`)
   - Public directory (`public/.htaccess`)
   - Dist directory (`dist/.htaccess`)

### Key .htaccess Rules Added:

```apache
# Handle SPA routing
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/sitemap\.xml$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/robots\.txt$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/favicon\.ico$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/api/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|map|json)$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L,QSA]

# Explicit error handling
ErrorDocument 404 /index.html
ErrorDocument 403 /index.html
```
