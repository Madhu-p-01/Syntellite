- **Proper Targeting**: All external links open in new tabs with security attributes

### Current State

**Production Ready**: The website is now fully optimized and ready for deployment with:
- ✅ Perfect mobile navigation with touch detection
- ✅ Clean services layout with minimal sidebar design
- ✅ Instant video playback with preloaded resources
- ✅ Responsive hero section showing all content
- ✅ Cross-device compatibility verified

### Active Decisions and Considerations

#### Mobile Navigation Strategy
- **Scroll Detection Approach**: Implemented 10px movement threshold to distinguish scroll from tap
- **Touch Event Handling**: Comprehensive `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd` handlers
- **Button vs Link Components**: Converted all service navigation to buttons for better mobile compatibility
- **Event Isolation**: Added proper event prevention to avoid scroll interference

#### Services Layout Design
- **Minimal Sidebar Toggle**: Small circular button (6x6) with glass effect instead of prominent bar
- **Scroll-to-Top Navigation**: Automatic scroll reset when navigating between service pages
- **Sidebar State Management**: Preserved scroll position within sidebar for better UX

#### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Resource Preloading**: Load all critical resources during initial loading screen
- **Video Optimization**: Changed from metadata to auto preload for instant playback. Implemented responsive WebM video formats for desktop and mobile.
- **Loading State Elimination**: Removed secondary loading spinners after main loader.
- **Thumbnail Loading**: Implemented a thumbnail-first loading strategy for the hero video to improve perceived performance. The initial loader no longer waits for the video to preload.

#### Hero Section Responsive Approach
- **Extended Height Strategy**: Increased from 160vh to 250vh to accommodate all content
- **Text Positioning Logic**: Desktop (10vh) vs Mobile (-12vh) for optimal visibility
- **Scroll Threshold Management**: Extended to 1000px on desktop for proper video coverage

### Next Steps

1. **Final Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing across all devices and browsers
2. **Performance Audit**: Verify loading times and optimization effectiveness
3. **Production Deployment**: Build and deploy optimized V1 website
4. **V2 Planning**: Begin detailed cosmic redesign planning

### Important Patterns and Preferences

#### Code Patterns
- **Touch Event Pattern**: Consistent scroll detection across all interactive elements
- **Navigation Pattern**: Unified approach with event prevention and timing control
- **Responsive Pattern**: Mobile-first design with desktop enhancements
- **State Management**: Clean separation of concerns with proper cleanup

#### Design Preferences
- **Minimal Visual Clutter**: Clean, professional appearance without unnecessary elements
- **Smooth Interactions**: All transitions and animations properly timed
- **Cross-Device Consistency**: Unified experience across all screen sizes
- **Performance First**: Optimization prioritized over complex features

### Learnings and Project Insights

#### Mobile Development
- **Touch Events Are Complex**: Proper scroll detection requires careful threshold management
- **Event Isolation Critical**: Preventing event bubbling essential for mobile navigation
- **Button Components Superior**: Better mobile compatibility than Link components for navigation
- **Testing Across Devices**: Real device testing reveals issues not visible in browser dev tools

#### Performance Optimization
- **Preloading Strategy**: Loading resources during initial screen eliminates secondary delays
- **Video Optimization**: Auto preload vs metadata makes significant UX difference
- **State Management**: Proper loading state management prevents visual glitches

#### Responsive Design
- **Viewport Height Units**: Careful use of vh units for cross-device compatibility
- **Transform Calculations**: Precise positioning calculations for different screen sizes
- **Scroll Behavior**: Different scroll thresholds needed for mobile vs desktop

#### User Experience
- **Scroll-to-Top Navigation**: Essential for multi-page navigation within same layout
- **Visual Feedback**: Proper hover states and transitions improve perceived performance
- **Clean Design**: Minimal visual elements often provide better user experience

### Technical Debt and Future Considerations

#### Current Technical Debt
- **Hero Section Complexity**: Multiple transform calculations could be simplified
- **Mobile Navigation Duplication**: Some code patterns repeated across components
- **CSS Organization**: Some responsive styles could be better organized

#### Future Enhancements
- **Animation Library**: Consider more sophisticated animation library for V2
- **State Management**: Evaluate need for more robust state management solution
- **Component Architecture**: Refactor for better reusability in V2 redesign
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance tracking for production deployment

### Development Environment

**Current Setup**:
- **Vite Development Server**: Running with network access enabled
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety implemented
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with proper SPA configuration

**Network Access**:
- Local: http://localhost:5173/
- Network: http://192.168.0.110:5173/ and http://10.7.0.158:5173/
- Cross-device testing enabled for real-world validation
