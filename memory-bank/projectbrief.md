# Syntellite Project Brief

## Project Overview
Syntellite is a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript and Vite. The project is currently in a "coming soon" phase where all routes redirect to a coming soon page.

## Core Requirements
- React SPA with TypeScript
- All routes redirect to `/coming-soon` page
- Manual deployment to hosting provider (files uploaded from dist folder)
- Proper SPA routing configuration to handle direct URL access and page refreshes

## Key Technical Decisions
- Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Uses React Router for client-side routing
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Manual deployment process (not automated CI/CD)

## Current Status
- Application redirects all routes to `/coming-soon` correctly
- Fixed 404 error on page refresh by updating .htaccess configuration
- Ready for manual deployment from dist folder
